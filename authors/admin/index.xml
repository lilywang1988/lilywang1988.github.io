      <description>&lt;p&gt;My name is Lili Wang, and I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Biostatistics at the University of Michigan School of Public Health. I am currently working on survival models under the supervision of Dr. Douglas E. Schaubel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My primary research interest has been developing novel methods and their software for analyzing complex failure time data, e.g., alternating recurrent events, competing risks, and hierarchically clustered events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, I am working as a research assistant for the University of Michigan Kidney Epidemiology and Cost Center. I actively participated in developing methods to monitor the performance of dialysis facilities by tracking their real-time mortality, readmission and hospitalization outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, I started to study regression trees and causal inference to optimize treatment assignments in observational studies.&lt;/p&gt;
