Most methods for recurrent events treat the outcome as a point process and, as such, neglect any associated event duration. This generally leads to a less informative and potentially biased analysis. We propose a joint model for the recurrent event rate (of incidence) and duration. The two processes are linked through a bivariate normal frailty. For example, when the event is hospitalization, we can treat the time to admission and length-of-stay as two alternating recurrent events. In our method, the regression parameters are estimated through a penalized partial likelihood, and the variance-covariance matrix of the frailty is estimated through a recursive estimating formula. Simulation results demonstrate that our method provides accurate parameter estimation, with relatively fast computation time. We illustrate the methods through an analysis of hospitalizations among end-stage renal disease patients.\n","date":1562716800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1562716800,"objectID":"a8513ef48efe58afc9b697f034aabc45","permalink":"https://lilywang1988.github.io/project/bivppl/","publishdate":"2019-07-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/bivppl/","section":"project","summary":"Recurrent event data are widely encountered in clinical and observational studies.

Very limited biomarkers are available for CTCL prognosis. We aimed to identify microRNA (miR) signatures to facilitate diagnostic and prognostic evaluations of CTCL. A cross-platform miR microarray identified 10 miRs that were differentially expressed between CTCL and benign inflammatory dermatosis patients. Subsequent reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction validation was used to generate a 5-miR–based diagnosing classifier, which showed high diagnostic accuracy in CTCL (area under the curve = 0.985 and 0.956 for training and testing set, respectively). Association between miR expressions and patient prognosis was studied. miR-155 and miR-200b were significantly associated with overall survival in CTCL patients, outperformed Ki-67. miR expressions were combined with Ki-67 to create a classifier for 5-year overall survival in CTCL patients. Our work provided miR signatures to facilitate CTCL diagnosis and prognosis with satisfying accuracy.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"MicroRNA signatures in diagnosis and prognosis of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"CUSUM with Headstarts\n","date":1533859200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1533859200,"objectID":"d4bb823ec20d4ebb1b256f806ea2549a","permalink":"https://lilywang1988.github.io/project/cusum/","publishdate":"2018-08-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/cusum/","section":"project","summary":"CUSUM with Headstarts","tags":["CUSUM","Monitoring Charts","Sequential Probability Ratio Test"],"title":"O-E CUSUM Charts to Monitor Survival and Readmission Outcomes","type":"project"},{"authors":["Scott Horowitz","Loïc Salmon","Philipp Koldewey","Logan S Ahlstrom","Raoul Martin","Shu Quan","Pavel V Afonine","Henry van den Bedem","Lili Wang","Qingping Xu","Raymond C Trievel","Charles L Brooks III","James CA Bardwell"],"categories":null,"content":"# #Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software. #  \n# #Click the Slides button above to demo Academic\u0026rsquo;s Markdown slides feature. #  \n[Supplementary notes can be added here, including code and math.]\n","date":1467331200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1467331200,"objectID":"f14c6963b8965f1d2c4b7de913ddfc0f","permalink":"https://lilywang1988.github.io/publication/super_spy2/","publishdate":"2016-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/super_spy2/","section":"publication","summary":"Challenges in determining the structures of heterogeneous and dynamic protein complexes have greatly hampered past efforts to obtain a mechanistic understanding of many important biological processes. One such process is chaperone-assisted protein folding. Obtaining structural ensembles of chaperone–substrate complexes would ultimately reveal how chaperones help proteins fold into their native state. To address this problem, we devised a new structural biology approach based on X-ray crystallography, termed residual electron and anomalous density (READ). READ enabled us to visualize even sparsely populated conformations of the substrate protein immunity protein 7 (Im7) in complex with the Escherichia coli chaperone Spy, and to capture a series of snapshots depicting the various folding states of Im7 bound to Spy. The ensemble shows that Spy-associated Im7 samples conformations ranging from unfolded to partially folded to native-like states and reveals how a substrate can explore its folding landscape while being bound to a chaperone.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Visualizing chaperone-assisted protein folding","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shu Quan","Lili Wang","Evgeniy V Petrotchenko","Karl AT Makepeace","Scott Horowitz","Jianyi Yang","Yang Zhang","Christoph H Borchers","James CA Bardwell"],"categories":null,"content":"# #Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software. #  \n# #Click the Slides button above to demo Academic\u0026rsquo;s Markdown slides feature. #  \n[Supplementary notes can be added here, including code and math.]\n","date":1391472000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1391472000,"objectID":"177ad297042949026b4a810d2aaa0de7","permalink":"https://lilywang1988.github.io/publication/super_spy1/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/super_spy1/","section":"publication","summary":"Experimental study of the role of disorder in protein function is challenging.

However, asexual seed formation or apomixis, avoiding meiosis and fertilization, is not found in the major food crops. To develop de novo synthesis of apomixis, we crossed Arabidopsis MiMe and dyad mutants that produce diploid clonal gametes to a strain whose chromosomes are engineered to be eliminated after fertilization. Up to 34% of the progeny were clones of their parent, demonstrating the conversion of clonal female or male gametes into seeds. We also show that first-generation cloned plants can be cloned again. Clonal reproduction through seeds can therefore be achieved in a sexual plant by manipulating two to four conserved genes.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Synthetic Clonal Reproduction Through Seeds","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"58e4492d795808da26ac4e2245989af4","permalink":"https://lilywang1988.github.io/project/aifrac/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/aifrac/","section":"project","summary":"","tags":["Recurrent events","Frailty models"],"title":"Design and Analysis of Clinical Trials in the Presence of Non-Proportional Hazards using Weighted Log-rank Tests","type":"project"}]
