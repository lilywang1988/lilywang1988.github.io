However, asexual seed formation or apomixis, avoiding meiosis and fertilization, is not found in the major food crops. To develop de novo synthesis of apomixis, we crossed Arabidopsis MiMe and dyad mutants that produce diploid clonal gametes to a strain whose chromosomes are engineered to be eliminated after fertilization. Up to 34% of the progeny were clones of their parent, demonstrating the conversion of clonal female or male gametes into seeds. We also show that first-generation cloned plants can be cloned again. Clonal reproduction through seeds can therefore be achieved in a sexual plant by manipulating two to four conserved genes.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Synthetic Clonal Reproduction Through Seeds","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mohan PA Marimuthu","Sylvie Jolivet","Maruthachalam Ravi","Lucie Pereira","Jayeshkumar N Davda","Laurence Cromer","Lili Wang","Fabien Nogué","Simon WL Chan","Imran Siddiqi","Raphaël Mercier"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.
